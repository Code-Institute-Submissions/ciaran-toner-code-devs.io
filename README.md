# First-milestone-project

I created this website to help beginer coders like myself find great resources to help them on there codeing journey. This includes
links to books, youtube chanells & online reading material. It can be a overwhelming with all the infomation that can be found on
how to start codeing and learning the basics.

The goal of the website is to give beginer web developers a good heas start & recoureced I belive they can rely on.

# UX

I wanted to incorperate a differnt design into the website & acheive a modern look using high contrast colors with gradients used 
throughout the design. I did not create any wireframes or mockups. In hindsight, this wasted alot of time & was bad practice.
Going foward I would recommend tools like Figma or Adobe xd but there are many more to choose from.

# Technologies used
<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>

The avascript used was for the navigation menu function on smaller devices. There where no Libraries used or frameworks.

<li>Css</li>
I did not use any css frameworks in this project as I wanted to learn reposvive & for the design to work around my layout. 
Also, it gave me a great opertunuity to use css grid and flexbox without restricting my design & possibly using less code.

</ul>
