# First milestone project 

This web app was made to provide content & links to resources for beginner web developers like my self to find reliable recources & information for beginner web developers. The links provided over technical information on HTML, CSS, Js & many more topics. There are also links provided to external resources which include books, learning platforms, & youtube tutorials.

The goal of the website is the have one site that provides one site for all the recources needed the get starting in codeing.

# UX

I wanted to incorporate a unique design for the website & achieve & modern look feel that would resinate with current design trends, such as using high contrast colours with gradients, dark tones on pages while trying to keep a clean UI. I did not create any wireframes or mockups, with no experience in doing a mockup design,I made the decision to design and make changes as I go. I took inspiration from other websites and developers to create a website unique to me. This in hindsight this approach has cost much more time than if I originally made a design before starting to develop the site. However, this gave me more opportunities to experiment with different designs & approaches to UI & UX.

# Features

The features are very basic now with top & bottom navigation with links. There is a Mobile dropdown menu which will provide users access throughout the site.


 ## Future features I would like to add.

  * Implement a back end technology to enable email sign up & the ability to comment on blogs & share to social media.
  * Implement a server-side rendering to retrieve popular articles the site and maybe other; possibly CSS tricks or other great sites.


# Technologies used

* HTML 5

* Javascript

 There is only a very small amount of javascript for the navigation menu function on smaller devices. There where no Libraries or frameworks used.

*  Vanilla CSS

  I did not use any CSS libraries or frameworks in this project as I felt it would be a great learning opportunity to use vanilla CSS. 
  This provided me with a greater understanding off CSS and all it has to offer.
  
  * SCSS
  
  I wanted to use a file structuring method rather than one main CSS file & to try to introduce modular CSS components to the site. Although I mainly just wrote CSS
  it was great to learn about sass and its benefits.
  
 * Google Fonts
 
  I used one imported font from google fonts and one other to use locally that I downloaded from google fonts & converted into a smaller file size. I think that may 
  have been unnecessary as it would have been easier to use google CDN alone.

# Testing

  My main testing was done using Firefox developer edition browser & visual studio code editor as I think Firefox offers great features for CSS & specifically when 
  using CSS grid. I also tested across different browsers such as chrome & safari to see if there were any issues, the only ones I came across was when I was using 
  safari on my mobile. Such as, on the main page, cards are set to hover but the function does not work well on safari mobile.
  
  I used visual studio code with 4 plugins to help with development. 
  
  * Beautify ( To maintain code indentation )
  * Live server ( This reloads the page when changes are made to the code )
  * Sass live reloader ( This reloaded the page when changes where made to sass & compiles sass files into one main CSS file & provied fall backs for older     
  browsers. The vs code folder contains the json file needed for the compile the sass.
  * Code snape ( I used this to take a picture of my folder structure )

  The main issue I came across the was positioning of elements using CSS grid and later flexbox. I tried to implement both throughout the site to provide me with a  
  a better understanding of when to use either or both.

  * Font sizes
  * Colors & accessibility in general for screen readers using SVG icons & links
  * Loading assets locally such as fonts & icons for the project, rather than using google fonts & Font awsome
  * 
  
  To check for HTML errors I used validator.org. There were warnings on the hyphens in the comments of the body but no errors.
  To check the CSS I used Jigsaw.org. Warnings were found for css falback rules relating to webkit rules applied but no errors.
