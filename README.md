# First-milestone-project

I created this website to help beginner coders like myself find great resources to help get started on their coding journey. The site contains
links to books, youtube channels & online reading material. It can be overwhelming with all the information that can be found on
how to start coding and learning the basics.

The goal of the website is to help provide beginner web developers with a good head start & resources that I believe they will help with web-development basics.

# UX

I wanted to incorporate a different design into the website & achieve a  unique & modern look using high contrast colors with gradients that are used throughout the design. I did not create any wireframes or mockups, in hindsight, this has wasted a lot of time & was bad practice.
Going forward I would recommend tools like Figma or Adobe xd but there are many more to choose from.


# Features

 ## Furture features I would like to add.

  * Implement a back end technology to enable subscribers.
  * Implement a server-side rendering to retrieve the most popular articles; possibly CSS tricks or other great resources.


# Technologies used

* Javascript

 There was only a very small amount of javascript for the navigation menu function on smaller devices. There where no Libraries frameworks used.

* CSS

  I did not use any CSS frameworks in this project as I wanted to learn CSS from scratch. 
  This gave me a great opportunity to use CSS grid and flexbox to learn & understand the basics of CSS.

# Testing

  I used visual studio code live server plugin for testing the site across the major browsers Firefox, Chrome & Safari. 
  I used firefox developer edition browser to   help with testing the layout across different screen sizes & performance mainly related to 
  (Font awesome icons js file).

The main issue I came across the mobile menu for the site & positioning of elements within the menu. Other issues that cropped up.

  * Font sizes
  * Colors & accessibility in general for screen readers
  * Loading assets locally such as fonts & icons for the project, rather than using google fonts & Font awsome
  * On the about page I have cards displayed that should move position and highlight a progress bar, this feature would not work in the Safari browser
